# Ember Fire Account

This README outlines the details of collaborating on this Ember addon, Ember Fire Account.

## Features

Ember Fire Account provides an account dashboard where users can modify their information (e.g. phone or address), an authentication helper called `re-authenticate` for selectively rendering content when a user is logged in, and account menu that displays links to all account pages. Links are currently defined in `account-menu.js`, so they can also be modified there.
